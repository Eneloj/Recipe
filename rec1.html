Tenderloin with Creamy Garlic Sauce Recipe
</div>
<p>Beef Tenderloin is the perfect cut for any celebration or special occasion meal. This is the piece of meat that filet mignon comes from so you know it’s good. This roast will melt in your mouth. Sure, it is a pricey piece of meat somewhere around $20 a pound, but you can make a meal that will serve a crowd with it for way less than you’d ever spend for this same dish at a restaurant. And yes, you can make this just as good as any restaurant!</p>

<ol>
	<li>In a blender, combine half of the mustard, eight garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon peppercorns; cover and process for 1 minute, scraping sides occasionally. Add 1 tablespoon oil; process until a paste forms. Spread over beef.</li>
	<li>In a large skillet, heat the remaining oil over medium-high heat. Brown beef, one piece at a time, on all sides. Place in a shallow roasting pan coated with cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 400° for 25-45 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145°; medium, 160°; well done, 170°). Remove to a warm serving platter. Let stand for 10-15 minutes.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, mince remaining garlic. In a saucepan, combine garlic, whipping cream, sour cream and remaining mustard and peppercorns. Cook and stir over low heat until heated through. Slice beef; serve with the sauce. Yield: 12 servings.</li>
