Egg Blossoms Recipe
</div>
	<p>Egg Blossoms. These are a simple, inexpensive but make a great addition to any breakfast or brunch menu!.These are great because they go together quickly and you can serve them warm or chilled. Since there is minimal prep or cleanup...these are one of my go-to recipes for the busy holidays. I like to make them when I have a brunch or a bunch of house guests because you just put them in a muffin pan and toss them in the oven and they are done! It is like having ham with a poached egg. These are also great for people that are on low-carb diets, gluten free diets, and for those that just love breakfast food! Leftovers freeze great too! For those that prefer scrambled eggs, you can just scramble your eggs or use liquid egg whites (like Egg Beaters) instead of the putting the egg in whole.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface; brush with butter. Top with a another sheet of phyllo; brush with butter. Cut into six 4-1/2-in. squares. (Keep remaining phyllo dough covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Repeat with remaining phyllo and butter.</li>
	<li>Stack three squares of layered phyllo in each of four greased muffin cups, rotating squares so corners do not overlap. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cheese into each cup. Top with one egg. Sprinkle with green onion, salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 350Â° for 25-30 minutes or until eggs are completely set and pastry is golden brown.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the salsa ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until onion is tender. Serve with egg cups. Yield: 4 servings.</li>
