	Chocolate Cream Torte Recipe
</div>
<p>Chocolate Cream Torte, aka Schokosahne Torte, is one of those most traditional German cakes that everyone loves. Here, Facebook foodie fan, Claudia Conley, has sent in her photo and recipe to share with us all. Thankfully, it's so easy to make! And her photo looks so wunderbar! Note: you'll want to plan this the day before by getting the chocolate cream ready first. The best part of this cake is truly the chocolate cream. So rich and not too sweet. Do make sure you buy the best bittersweet chocolate you can</p>
